# YTMusic-Discord-RPC
This project aims to enable users to gain a sort of Discord Rich Presence for YouTube Music since GOOGLE does not make an official integration for Discord.

# How do I set it up ?

It is quite easy and does not require much work.

1. Head over to the Discord developer portal : https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create an Application by giving it a name, e.g. "YouTube Music".
3. Add the YouTube Logo PNG under "Rich Presence -> Art Assets" (Optional).
4. Copy the Application ID from the GENERAL INFORMATION TAB.
5. Paste the ID into the code sheet, can't miss the location.
6. Add the TAPERMONKEY SCRIPT to the TAPERMONKEY ADD-ON for your browser.
