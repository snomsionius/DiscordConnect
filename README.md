# YTMusic-Discord-RPC
This project aims to enable users to gain a sort of Discord Rich Presence for YouTube Music since GOOGLE does not make an official integration for Discord.

# How do I set it up ?

It is quite easy and does not require much work.

1. Head over to the Discord developer portal : https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create an Application by giving it a name, e.g. "YouTube Music"
3. Add the YouTube Logo PNG under "Rich Presence -> Art Assets" (Optional)
4. Copy the Application ID from the GENERAL INFORMATION TAB.
